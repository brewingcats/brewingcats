{{< head 3 "How It Works" >}}

{{< big O >}}once you contact us via the contact button we schedule a time for a virtual meeting to talk about your needs and the chart or menu you need created, we all agree on 
the initial design and the custom design elements/photos, if you're using photos you will need send us those, don't worry we will give you details on how to take the best pictures. Once the initial 
pricing is paid (see pricing for info) we collect the data for your chart or menu and get to work, we setup a preview of the chart that you need and create some initial design for you to 
review, once the design is approved we publish the chart or menu to our production instance. If you elected to have a custom domain managed by us, we create it and put your chart or 
menu behind this custom domain, if you own the domain and decide to give us control we can also put your chart or menu behind this domain (or subdomain) too, if you don't want to pay for 
a custom domain we put the chart on our easy-to-remember domain similar to {{< link src="https://graficos.info" label="https://graficos.info/your-business-name" >}}. We also create a 
{{< bicon upcscan themeColor >}} QR code that can be used in your business/site to access your newly created diagram similar to the one below
