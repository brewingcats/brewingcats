{{< head 2 "Welcome to the First Edition of Mexican Lottery Board Game NFT!" >}}
{{< big L >}}otería (Spanish word meaning "lottery") is a traditional game of chance, similar to bingo, but using images on a deck of cards instead of numbered ping pong balls. Every image 
has a name and an assigned number, but the number is usually ignored. Each player has at least one tabla, a board with a randomly created 4 x 4 grid of pictures with their corresponding 
name and number. Players choose a tabla to play with, from a variety of previously created tablas, each with a different selection of images.

{{< big T >}}he traditional Lotería card deck is composed of a set of 54 different cards, each with a different picture. To start the game, the caller (cantor, Spanish for "singer") shuffles 
the deck. One by one, the caller picks a card from the deck and announces it to the players by its name, sometimes using a verse before reading the card name. Each player locates the 
matching pictogram of the card just announced on their board and marks it off with a chip or other kind of marker. In Mexico, it is traditional to use small rocks, crown corks or pinto 
beans as markers. The winner is the first player that shouts "¡Buena!" or "¡Lotería!" right after completing a tabla or a previous agreed pattern: row, column, diagonal, or a pozo.

{{< link src="https://github.com/brewingcats/lotería" label="PowerShell module: Loteria" >}} hosted in GitHub. It contains the cmdlets for each operation as well as a way to 
simulate a game from beginning to end

{{< head 3 "Design of Lottery Cards" >}}

{{< big T >}}he winning card, also known as the thophy card tells essentially that you've won the game. There are two types of throphy cards, the first is emitted naturally when the game 
ends by having a board with the combination of the released set of cards, this throphy card will contains the "`Winner`" designation in addition to its regular attributes. Whenever 
a new owner acquires 16 cards and a matching board (all matching the same edition), this owner can now {{<link src="https://twitter.com/brewingcats" label="request">}} to mint a new 
throphy card, this trophy card will be issued with the designation "`### Winner`" in addition to its regular attributes. All throphy cards will contain the edition it belongs to and the 
codes of the winning combination. You can the the proud winner if you have 16 cards, its matching board, and the throphy card that proves you've won. The design of this card will be reserved 
for whenever a winner has been declared

{{< head 3 "Minting more Boards" >}}

{{< big I >}}f the demand for the game is strong is natural for more users to be wanting to play the game, in order to address potential demand we've created the following form for the
community to let us know of this, based on the responses on this form we will mint more boards according to these rules:
- After `100` requests additional `4` boards will be minted and you will be able to buy one
- If a minted board wins the game the game will end declaring the winner
- In order to mint `4` additional boards the number of responses has to increase to `n = n * 2` where `n` is the current limit e.g. 100, 200, 400, 800, etc.


Current limit of votes to mint more boards: `100`
