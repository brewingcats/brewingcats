{{< big B >}}rewing Cats LLC is a small, independent company looking to enrich the web with quality content in several areas. Its owners do it in a fun and respectful 
way. Key focus areas are entertainment (movies, video games, and more) as well as software development. We have a special view of how the web should work and we 
try to lead by example

{{< head 3 "Our View of the Web" >}}
{{< big W >}}e believe the web should be fun, inclusive, respectful, welcoming of all beliefs and accessible to everyone. Additionally as yet-another-website, there have 
responsibilities that we all must uphold to ensure we keep quality high and ultimately contribute towards a better humane society

- **Truth**. Lies and deceit should have no place in a progressive society and thus spreading them should be stopped. At Brewing Cats we commit to be truthful 
and to avoid spreading false information, our posts are truthful to the best of our knowledge and if we ever make a mistake we are responsible and we will not 
hide it but rather expose the truth
- **Data Usage**. Data is knowledge, data is power. Nowadays most websites have and obscene craving for harvesting our behavior data in order to be sold to the 
highest bidder in order to keep people under control, predictability comes first (also liberty?) when they know what will we do, what will we need, what will we 
purchase in order to feed us with their products. Complicated psychological models are created from our behaviors that determine how will we act and react in an 
effort to predict what and how to sell us. Finally predictability is just the initial step, further steps are to '*condition*' people by means of highly targeted 
ads in order to make us crave and desire the things they want to sell us. Based on that is safe to assume that data is quite important, and our commitment is to 
not collect data about you for those specific purposes but only to inform us about how to improve our website and the contents of it. Additionally the data that 
you as user generate is yours to keep, as thus we will share all of the collected data with our users so that our users also know what data we get and how is this 
data is being used. Finally we will give our users the option to turn off data collection as is our users' right
- **Give More than we Take**. We believe in contributing to a better society and a better and open web by sharing with the world software and media. Below are some 
of our open channels where we share *our* stuff with the world (we will add more as we discover better ways of sharing):
