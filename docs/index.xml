      <description>Welcome to the First Edition of Mexican Lottery Board Game NFT! LoterÃ­a (Spanish word meaning &amp;ldquo;lottery&amp;rdquo;) is a traditional game of chance, similar to bingo, but using images on a deck of cards instead of numbered ping pong balls. Every image has a name and an assigned number, but the number is usually ignored. Each player has at least one tabla, a board with a randomly created 4 x 4 grid of pictures with their corresponding name and number.</description>

      <description>In order to measure our criteria of success with our website (that is to provide a delightful experience to our users) we need to know and understand how it is being used. We plan to achieve this through the use of telemetry data, this data will provide us insights regarding any usability issues, what type of content users enjoy the most, and other types of issues
The use of telemetry is a common and accepted practice for most websites, nowadays users aren&amp;rsquo;t even informed about this, let alone letting them know about the usage given to this data (i.</description>

      <description>This post allows you to draw polygons on top of a picture of your choice. This comes handy for several scenarios, in our case we have used it to get path coordinates for Tableau visualizations. With the path coordinates we were able to draw the resulting polygons on top of the images in Tableau with the ability to correlate this data for zones or areas that we wanted. To view the usage sample check out this post.</description>

      <description>LoZ: BOTW - Custom Alphabet If you played Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild you might have noticed it has its own alphabet system. Looking online for answers I found an equivalency for the characters in it and I built an online message generator based on the game character set. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, just select the style (blue/golden) type your message and get the equivalency. Supported characters are a-z, 0-9, -, .</description>

Below are the steps to retrieve the code
Adding the ShortCode to your Hugo Site To add support for embedding Tableau Public vizzes simply copy our shortcode into the following path /layouts/shortcodes/tableau.</description>
