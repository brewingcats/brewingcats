      <description>Welcome to the First Edition of Mexican Lottery Board Game NFT! Loter√≠a (Spanish word meaning &amp;ldquo;lottery&amp;rdquo;) is a traditional game of chance, similar to bingo, but using images on a deck of cards instead of numbered ping pong balls. Every image has a name and an assigned number, but the number is usually ignored. Each player has at least one tabla, a board with a randomly created 4 x 4 grid of pictures with their corresponding name and number.</description>
